        <p>I was born in Portland,On March 28th, 1985. I grew up on the computer and have always been interested in learning the functionality of programming. I believe with hard work and dedication, you can achieve just about anything you set your goals to. Learning how to program has been my number one priority for the last year and one of my life long goals. </p>
