      <p>I was born in Portland,On March 28th, 1985. I grew up on the computer and have always been interested in learning the functionality of programming. I believe with hard work and dedication, you can achieve just about anything you set your goals to. Learning how to program has been my number one priority for the last year and one of my life long goals.

        <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
